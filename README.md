# Domain Expansion 🌀

Have you ever:  
- Wanted to **stalk**—I mean **find out**—if a website has *spicy* subdomains?  
- Needed to know if your **crush** is secretly hosting a world-changing project under their own website?  
- Felt the urge to **Domain Expand** like in *Jujutsu Kaisen*?  

Well, my friend, I’ve got just the thing for you! What does it do? It expands (or *explores*) any domain you feed it, giving you all the juicy info you crave. Subdomains? Got 'em. Colors that will make your eyes do a happy dance? Oh, you better believe it.

- **Subdomain Discovery:** It finds 'em all—big ones, small ones, and the ones your crush probably forgot to hide.  
- **Tree View Output:** Displays domains and subdomains in an orderly and visually satisfying tree view. Perfect for staying organized while looking awesome.
