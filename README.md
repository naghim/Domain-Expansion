# Domain Expansion 🌀

Have you ever:

- Wanted to **stalk**—I mean **find out**—if a website has _spicy_ subdomains?
- Needed to know if your **crush** is secretly hosting a world-changing project under their own website?
- Felt the urge to **Domain Expand** like in _Jujutsu Kaisen_?

Well, my friend, I’ve got just the thing for you! What does it do? It expands (or _explores_) any domain you feed it, giving you all the juicy info you crave. Subdomains? Got 'em. Colors that will make your eyes do a happy dance? Oh, you better believe it.

## 🎥 **Demo time!**

_Warning: This tool’s UI contains colors so vibrant, your screen might start demanding royalties._ 🌈

## ⚙️ **Features**

- **Domain exploration:** Feed it a domain, and watch it expand your world.
- **Subdomain discovery:** It finds 'em all—big ones, small ones, and the ones your crush probably forgot to hide.
- **Tree view output:** Displays domains and subdomains in an orderly and visually satisfying tree view. Perfect for staying organized while looking awesome.
- **Customizable colors:** Want rainbows to explode on your screen? Done. Prefer a more _boring_ (no offense) grayscale look? We got you. Adjust the color settings to match your vibe.
- **Now in Rust!** Faster, safer, and cooler. The Rust version is optimized for speed and reliability, so you can expand domains with efficiency and style.
